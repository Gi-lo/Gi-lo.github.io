In my erlier developer years I have created several applications for the **iOS jailbreak** community. The most successful one, [Snowcover](https://www.google.de/search?q=Snowcover&oq=Snowcover&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j5j69i60.146j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fp=2ad9586ad4eb529e&q=Snowcover+ios), helped me getting interviewed at [MacStories](http://www.macstories.net/stories/gi-lo-interview/). Though it was very interesting pushing iOS to the limit, I am currently **not interested** to work on any new tweaks or to update existing ones.

You can find more information about SnowCover searching the [internet](https://www.google.de/search?q=snowcover+ios&oq=snowcover+ios&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l2.4804j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=snow+cover+cydia).
