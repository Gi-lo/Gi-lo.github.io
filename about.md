Hello, my name is Giulio Petek and I am a 23-year-old Android and iOS developer living in the beautiful city [Bochum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochum). 

I currently craft premium mobile Applications at [Rheinfabrik](http://www.rheinfabrik.de/). Besides I am also enrolled as an [ITS Student](https://www.ei.rub.de/studium/its/). In my spare time I love to go out and have fun with friends in games such as soccer and foosball. 

If you have any questions don't hesitate to drop me an [e-mail](mailto:giulio.petek@gmail.com").
