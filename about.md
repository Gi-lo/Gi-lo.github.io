Hello, my name is Giulio Petek and I am a 22-year-old iOS and Android developer from the beautiful city [DÃ¼sseldorf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%BCsseldorf). 

I currently craft premium mobile Applications at [Rheinfabrik](http://www.rheinfabrik.de/). Besides development I love to go out and have fun with friends in games such as soccer and foosball. If you have any questions don't hesitate to drop me an [e-mail](mailto:giulio@rheinfabrik.de").
